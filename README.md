## 👋 Welcome to my corner of the internet

Here you'll find my ad hoc thoughts, front-end experiments, technical articles, and anything else that I want. That's the beauty of having your own website: it can be whatever you want it to be!

## 🧐 What's inside?

theAdhocracy is built on the Jamstack, a modern tech stack wtih ReactJS at the heart. Specifically:

- [**Astro**](https://astro.build/)
- [**Craft CMS**](https://craftcms.com/)
- [**Netlify**](https://www.netlify.com/) [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/c49878f2-401f-4ffe-a02a-8adb4359c4f8/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/hilarious-flan-2f4dc8/deploys)
- ![Gitmoji](https://img.shields.io/badge/gitmoji-%20😜%20😍-FFDD67.svg?style=flat-square "Gitmoji")
- ❤

It's also built on the foundations of the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/), with accessibility (#a11y) at its core. If you can spot any improvements than can be made feel free to ping me a message (Twitter is probably best) or make a pull request.
